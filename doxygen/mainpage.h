/** \mainpage LPJ-GUESS documentation

This is the documentation of the source code for LPJ-GUESS, automatically
generated from the source files and comments.

This documentation is generated from the LPJ-GUESS source code comments with
the tool Doxygen. If you have a look at the comments in the LPJ-GUESS source
code you can see that a lot of them look a little different from ordinary
C++ comments. For instance by using /// instead of just //, or starting with
/** instead of just /*. These are Doxygen comments which are extracted and
included in this documentation. For more information about how to write
Doxygen comments, see http://www.doxygen.org .

You can browse the source code documentation by classes, files, functions etc.
