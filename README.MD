========

Branch of Frankfurt-BiK-F Data Modelling center Gitlab repository

(full description to do)


PLEASE NOTE:
==============

-- 21.10.2022

Added sla variation - changes results but no large difference
Added cton and ctop tradeoffs - reduces biomass and especially cton and ctop ratios, increases decomposition.
Added wsg variation - increases biomass in relation to previous implementation, but still relatively low.


-- 20.10.2022

Added variables to individual, maybe issues with BLAZE, transfer litter, canexch.cpp line 2931 because still with pft cton variables.
