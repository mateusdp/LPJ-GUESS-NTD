# EditorConfig: https://EditorConfig.org

# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple
# developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The
# EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles
# and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the
# file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily
# readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
